There are three core concepts you need to know with Strickland:

1. **[Creating Validators](Validators.md)** that implement your validation rules
2. **[Performing Validation](Validation.md)** to execute a validator against a value
3. **[Validation Results](ValidationResults.md)** are the output of validation for the given validator and value
