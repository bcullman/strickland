# Logo Design Notes

## Describe what your organization or product does and its target audience

Strickland is a JavaScript validation framework with a focus on extensibility and composability. Developers use Strickland to implement data entry validation into their web applications.

Strickland is a light-weight framework that has only a few concepts that developers need to learn, but it is usable in a wide variety of scenarios and it can empower any style of user experience that developers need.

The website for Strickland is available at http://strickland.io.

The target audience are developers who also use the following libraries and platforms to build line-of-business applications with lots of data entry scenarios.

- https://reactjs.org
- https://redux.js.org
- https://reacttraining.com/react-router/
- http://graphql.org
- https://nodejs.org

## Is there anything else you would like to communicate to the designers?

The name Strickland comes from Back to the Future.

Principal Stanford Strickland was the disciplinarian of Hill Valley High School--he was the rules monger. The Strickland validation framework makes it easy for developers to implement their validation rules.

This connection is made because the React ecosystem uses a design pattern called "Flux," and with that design pattern name, it has become common in the React ecosystem to play on the Back to the Future reference.

While not required in the designs, I do hope to see some concepts that bring in the Principal Strickland reference.
