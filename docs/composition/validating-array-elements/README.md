# Validating Array Elements

Validators can easily validate scalar values, taking a single value and producing a validation result. It's common to need to validate arrays of values too, where every array element needs to be validated against a validator \(or an array of validators\).

While custom validators can easily be created for validating arrays and their elements, Strickland also provides a built-in [`arrayElements`](https://github.com/jeffhandley/strickland/tree/109f2edc49c8b8ff39bf422630ddf0b96183f4b2/docs/composition/validating-array-elements/arrayelements.md) validator to make array element validation easy.
