# Core Concepts

There are three core concepts you need to know with Strickland:

1. [**Validators**](validators.md) are implementations of your validation rules
2. [**Validation**](https://github.com/jeffhandley/strickland/tree/540c7d48fdf33ad2fd2081ce7d2ad87049a54322/docs/introduction/performing-alidation.md) is the act of executing a validator against a value
3. [**Validation Results**](validation-results.md) are the output of validation for the given validator and value
