There are three core concepts you need to know with Strickland:

1. **[Validators](creating-validators.md)** are implementations of your validation rules
2. **[Validation](performing-alidation.md)** is the act of executing a validator against a value
3. **[Validation Results](validation-results.md)** are the output of validation for the given validator and value
